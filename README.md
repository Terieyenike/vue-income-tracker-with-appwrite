# Income Tracker with VueJS and Appwrite

An income tracker application built with Vue and Appwrite allows users to monitor and keep track of their expenses. The
income tracker app makes it easy for anyone to add, edit, update, and delete any information from the client-side, and
it updates accordingly in the database.
